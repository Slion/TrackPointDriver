# TrackPointDriver
This is an alternative ThinkPad TrackPoint driver for Windows
offering a reliable TrackPoint scrolling experience.

# Story
I've been using a couple of [Lenovo ThinkPad USB Keyboard with TrackPoint] for over a decade
and they are still going strong.
The newest [ThinkPad TrackPoint Keyboard II], while pleasant to type on,
has a rather unimpressive layout by comparison. I ruled out upgrading for the time being.
One unique feature I use most on the TrackPoint is scrolling while holding down the middle button.
However Lenovo [official driver] TrackPoint scrolling implementation is rather unreliable.
On some application it just won't work.
On others like Visual Studio it will work for a while until it won't.
This driver primary goal is therefore to get the scrolling working everywhere, reliably,
exactly like your standard mouse wheel. 

# Feature
TrackPoint scrolling: hold down middle button to scroll vertically or horizontally using your TrackPoint.

# Download
Coming soon on slions.net.

# Installation
* First install the [official driver] from Lenovo.
You will still need it to be able to adjust sensitivy and other parameters from Windows Mouse Properties settings.
* TODO: Make sure test signing is enabled on your computer.
* Go to Windows Device Manager.
* Locate your TrackPoint device below "Mice and other pointing devices".
* Right click your TrackPoint device and select "Update driver".
* Click "Browse my computer for drivers".
* Click "Let me pick a list off available drivers on my computer".
* Click "Have Diskâ€¦" button.
* "Browse" to this driver location on your computer and select the INF file.
* Select the driver and click "Next".
* Validate various Windows warning messages if needed until installation succeeds.

# Usage
You can still adjust TrackPoint stick sensitivity as usual from Windows Mouse Properties.
Hold down the middle button and use your TrackPoint for mouse wheel emulation.
It works both vertically and horizontally.

# Hardware
While designed to work for [Lenovo ThinkPad USB Keyboard with TrackPoint]
this driver could potentially work for other TrackPoint hardware or even any mouse pointer device.

# Development
Use DebugView and enable verbose kernel capture to obtain debug output from a driver debug build.

# Conclusion
That was an interresting dip in Windows kernel driver development.
Actually implementing a proper mouse wheel emulation from a mouse driver filter was really straight forward.
That brings the question: why could Lenevo engineers not get this done years ago? Go figure!
